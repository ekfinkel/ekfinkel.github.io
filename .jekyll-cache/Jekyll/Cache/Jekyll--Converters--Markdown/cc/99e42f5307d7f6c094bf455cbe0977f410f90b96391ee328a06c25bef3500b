I"y<p>The internet is a nice place to be in. As most of you already know, I love exploits. CVEs at the other side are the identifiers of vulnerabilities, so … you could say that each CVE has (or should have) an exploit associated. There are too many CVE’s out there, but I am on working towards having one exploit per CVE.</p>
